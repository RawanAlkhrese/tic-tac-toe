------------------------------
## Motivation: 
Want to imporive my skills and learning Jquery by implementing Tic Tac Toe game 

## How It Works:
Player one will start "X". if one of them won the score will be updated and they cannot click on the game. They have two options: play again or rest the game and remove the scores.

## Files:
- **index.html:** html file
- **style:** CSS file 
- **script:** Jquery code
- **jquery.min:** compressed production jQuery 3.4.1 

## Future Work:
Planning to making the web page responsive using bootstrap and try to implement the game using Machine or deep Learning.
